# Thesis Project: Accelerating Elliptic Curve Cryptography using Xilinx VCK5000 Platform

## Project Title:
**Optimizing Montgomery Multiplication for Elliptic Curve Cryptography on the Xilinx VCK5000 Platform**

## Overview:
This project focuses on enhancing the performance of Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) by accelerating one of its core mathematical operations, Large Number Modular Multiplication. By leveraging the heterogeneous architecture of the VCK5000, including AI Engines, Programmable Logic (PL), and Adaptable Processing Units (APUs), we aim to achieve significant performance improvements. 


## Motivation:
Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) is widely adopted in modern secure systems due to its strong security properties and smaller key sizes compared to traditional cryptosystems. However, its reliance on complex modular arithmetic operations makes it computationally intensive.

With emerging applications such as IoT, autonomous systems, and privacy-preserving technologies demanding faster cryptographic operations, accelerating ECC becomes crucial. This project contributes to the field by exploring FPGA-accelerated solutions on cutting-edge platforms.
